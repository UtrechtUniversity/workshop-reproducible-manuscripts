## Exercise

Take a couple of minutes to play around with the possibilities of _inline code_:

1. Do a simple calculation such as `25 + 25` within your text.
2. Report the number of "Gentoo" and/or "Chinstrap" species of penguins within the data (hint: refer to the example in the slides).
3. Try out one other (simple) in-line computation or calculation!
