## Exercise

Take a couple of minutes to play around with the possibilities of _inline code_:

- Do a simple calculation such as `r knitr::inline_expr("25 + 25")` within your text.

- Report the number of "Gentoo" and/or "Chinstrap" species of penguins within the data (hint: refer to the example in the slides).

- Try out one other (simple) computation or calculation!
