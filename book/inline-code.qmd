# Inline code {.unnumbered}

You can insert code results or quick calculations directly into the text of a Quarto document. This is very useful if you want to describe computation results in your manuscript in a reproducible way, while minimizing errors.

## An example in R ([source](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/computations/rstudio.html#inline-code))

```{r}
#| label: Load the penguins dataset
#| echo: false
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins_data <- penguins
```

> There are `r sum(penguins_data$species=="Adelie")` penguins of the "Adelie" species in the dataset.

This line was created as follows:

````
```{{r}}
#| label: Load the penguins dataset
#| echo: false
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins_data <- penguins
```
````

````md
> There are `r knitr::inline_expr("sum(penguins_data$species=='Adelie')")` penguins of the Adelie species in the dataset.
````

By enclosing the inline code with `` `r ` ``, the code will be executed when the document is rendered, displaying not the code but the results of the computation. There will be no additional text formatting either, which makes the inline code output indistinguishable from surrounding text.

## In Python

For Python, this feature will be hugely simplified from [Quarto v1.4](https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.4/inline.html) onwards.

````
```{{python}}
x = 5
```

The answer is `{python} x`
````
For earlier Quarto versions, the solution is a bit overly complicated and does not always seem to work as well:

````
```{{python}}
#| echo: false
radius = 10
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
display(Markdown("""
The radius of the circle is {radius}.
""".format(radius = radius)))
```
````
