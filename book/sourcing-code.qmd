## Exercises

The R script `do_addition.R` and the Python script `do_addition.py` in the `scripts` folder contain a function to perform simple addition. The function takes two numbers as arguments, adds them together, and outputs the result to the console.

1.  Complete the following code to include the `do_addition` function into your Quarto document:

::: panel-tabset

### R
````
```{{r}}
#| label: Include the do_addition.R function in the current file
# Replace this line with your answer
```
````
### Python
````
```{{python}}
#| label: Include the do_addition.py function in the current file
# Replace this line with your answer
```
````
:::

2.  Use the `do_addition` function to add two numbers of your choice to test whether your answer in a was correct!

::: panel-tabset

### R
````
```{{r}}
#| label: perform an addition to check whether the sourcing worked
# Replace this line with your answer
```
````
#### Python
````
```{{python}}
#| label: perform an addition to check whether the sourcing worked
# Replace this line with your answer
```
