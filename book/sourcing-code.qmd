## Exercises

The R script `do_addition.R` and the Python script `do_addition.py` in the `scripts` folder contain a function to perform simple addition. The function takes two numbers as arguments, adds them together, and outputs the result to the console.

1.  Add a new code chunk to your manuscript that includes the `do_addition` function into your Quarto document.
2.  Use the `do_addition` function to add two numbers of your choice to test whether your answer in a was correct!
