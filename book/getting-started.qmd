# Getting Started {.unnumbered}

Once you have followed all the steps for [Installation and setup](#installation-and-setup),
you can start to create the Quarto document that you will be working in during the workshop.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

**1. Create an RStudio Project**

- In RStudio, click _File_ > _New Project_ > _Existing Directory_. 
- Browse to your folder `my-reproducible-manuscript` in which you have saved the workshop materials.
- Check the _Open in new session_ option.
- Click _Create Project_. This will create a `my-reproducible-manuscript.Rproj` file.

**2. Document your project for reproducibility**

Your project already contains pre-made folders, a README file and a License.
Open the `README.md` file and fill it with a few relevant details, for example:

- Purpose and contents of the project
- Your name (Author)
- The date of creation
- Etc.

**3. Create a Quarto document for your manuscript.**

- In RStudio, click _File_ -> _New File_ -> _Quarto Document_
- Give your document a title, such as `My Reproducible Manuscript`.
- Add yourself as an author.
- For now, the default output format (HTML) and engine (knitr) are fine.
- Uncheck the _Use visual markdown editor_ option.
- Click _Create_. A new Quarto document opens.

**4. Render the Quarto document to HTML**

- Save the Quarto document in the `docs` folder within the `my-reproducible-manuscript` folder.  
Give the file a clear name, without using  spaces. For example, `my-reproducible-manuscript.qmd`.
- Once everything has been saved correctly, click the _Render_ button in the menu bar.
- The rendered HTML copy of your document will appear in your web browser or alongside the editor in RStudio. You will also see a `my-reproducible-manuscript.html` file appear in the `docs` folder.

## Python

**1. Open the `my-reproducible-manuscript` folder in Visual Studio Code**

In VS Code, click _File_ > _Open Folder..._ > `my-reproducible-manuscript` > _Select folder_.

**2. Document your project for reproducibility**

Your project already contains pre-made folders, a README file and a License.
Open the `README.md` file and fill it with a few relevant details, for example:

- Purpose and contents of the project
- Your name (Author)
- The date of creation
- Etc.

**3. Create a Quarto document for your manuscript.**

- In the Command Palette of VS Code (usually at the top of the screen, looks like a search bar), type `> Quarto: New Document`. 
This will open up a new empty Quarto document.
- Give your new document a Title, such as `My Reproducible Manuscript`.
- Copy the following block of text and code into your Quarto document:

````md
## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{{python}}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{{python}}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
````

**4. Render the Quarto document to HTML**

- Save the Quarto document in the `docs` folder within the `my-reproducible-manuscript` folder.  
Give the file a clear name, without using  spaces. For example, `my-reproducible-manuscript.qmd`.
- In VS Code, click _Terminal_ -> _Split Terminal_
- In the newly created Terminal, run the following command:

```
quarto render my-reproducible-manuscript.qmd
```

The rendered HTML copy of your document will appear in your web browser or alongside the editor in VS Code.
You will also see a `my-reproducible-manuscript.html` file appear in the `docs` folder.
