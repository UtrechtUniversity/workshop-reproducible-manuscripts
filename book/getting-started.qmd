# Getting Started {.unnumbered}

::: {.panel-tabset}

## R

**1. Create a Project in RStudio**

- In RStudio, click _File_ -> _New Project_ -> _New Directory_ -> _New Project_. 

- Give your project directory a clear name, without using spaces. For example, `my-reproducible-manuscript`.

- Make sure your project will be created (as a subdirectory) in an accessible place on your system.

- Check the _Open in new session_ option.

- Click _Create Project_.

**2. Structure your Project for reproducible work**

- Generate a directory structure by running the following piece of code in the _Console_ of RStudio:

```{r}
#| eval: false

dir.create("data", recursive = TRUE)
dir.create("docs", recursive = TRUE)
dir.create("results", recursive = TRUE)
dir.create("R", recursive = TRUE)

# install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)

usethis::use_readme_md(open = rlang::is_interactive())
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = NULL)
```

**3. Get the data for your Project**

- Obtain the data and place it in the correct folder by running the following piece of code in the _Console_ of RStudio:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

write.csv(palmerpenguins::penguins_raw, "data/data.csv")
```

**4. Create a Quarto document for your manuscript.**

- In RStudio, click _File_ -> _New File_ -> _Quarto Document_

- Give your document a Title, such as `My Reproducible Manuscript`.

- Deselect the _Use visual markdown editor_ option.

- Click _Create_.

**6. Render the Quarto document to HTML**

- Click the _Render_ button in the menu bar.

- Give the Quarto document a clear name, without using spaces. For example, `my-reproducible-manuscript`.

- Save the Quarto document in the `docs` folder you recently created.

- Once everything has been saved correctly, click the _Render_ button in the menu bar again.

- The rendered, HTML copy of your document will appear in your web browser or alongside the editor in RStudio.

7. **Download Other Workshop Materials**

- Right-click on the following link and select _Save Link As..._: [workshop-materials.zip](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/raw/main/workshop-materials.zip)

- Extract the contents of the zipped file.

- Copy only the `do-addition.R` script into the `scripts` folder of your new project.

## Python

1. **Create a new folder on your computer**

- Name this folder `my-reproducible-manuscript` and make sure it is in an accessible location on your system. 

2. **Open the newly created folder in Visual Studio Code**

- In VS Code, click _File_ -> _Open Folder..._ -> `my-reproducible-manuscript`

3. **Structure your Project for reproducible work**

- In VS Code, click _Terminal_ -> _New Terminal_

- In the Terminal, type `python`. If you see `>>>` pop up in the Terminal, then you can proceed.

- Generate a directory structure by running the following piece of code in the Terminal:

```
import os

os.mkdir("data")
os.mkdir("docs")
os.mkdir("results")
os.mkdir("scripts")
```
You might want to run it line-by-line.

4. **Get the data for your Project**

- Obtain the data and place it in the correct folder by running the following piece of code in the Terminal:

```
pip install palmerpenguins

import pandas as pd

from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()

penguins.to_csv('data/data.csv')
```

5. **Create a Quarto document for your manuscript.**

- In the Command Palette of VS Code, type `> Quarto: New Document`.

- Give your new document a Title, such as `My Reproducible Manuscript`.

6. **Copy the following block of text + code into your Quarto document.**

````md
## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{{python}}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{{python}}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
````

7. **Render the Quarto document to HTML**

- Save the Quarto document in the `docs` folder you recently created.

- Give the Quarto document a clear name, without using spaces. For example, `my-reproducible-manuscript`.

- In VS Code, click _Terminal_ -> _Split Terminal_

- In the newly created Terminal, run the following command:

```
quarto render my-reproducible-manuscript.qmd
```

- The rendered, HTML copy of your document will appear in your web browser or alongside the editor in VS Code.

8. **Download Other Workshop Materials**

- Right-click on the following link and select _Save Link As..._: [workshop-materials.zip](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/raw/main/workshop-materials.zip)

- Extract the contents of the zipped file.

- Copy only the `do-addition.py` script into the `scripts` folder of your new project.
