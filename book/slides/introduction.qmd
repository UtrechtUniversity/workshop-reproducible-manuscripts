## More Specifically...

We want _Dynamic Document Generation_, where we can:

- combine narrative with code

- automatically generate figures and tables

- automatically render results in text

- format the content into a scientific paper (including citations!)

- rinse & repeat

## Advantages

- One major benefit is the elimination of human error in copying and pasting results, as automated methods can update results, figures, and tables with major revisions. 

_Using an automated method for scraping APA-formatted stats out of PDFs, Nuijten et al. (⊕2016) found that over 10% of p-values in published papers were inconsistent with the reported details of the statistical test, and 1.6% were what they called “grossly” inconsistent, e.g. difference between the p-value and the test statistic meant that one implied statistical significance and the other did not. Nearly half of all papers had errors in them._

## Advantages

- The use of reproducible documents also allows for easy revisions and specification of desired figures and tables.

_When revisions are requested, one might have to tweak tables and figures by hand constantly, leading to a major incentive never to rerun analyses because it would mean re-pasting and re-illustratoring all the numbers and figures in a paper._

## Advantages

- Furthermore, computational reproducibility is promoted, which allows others to easily verify and replicate research findings. 

While programming environments may seem counter-intuitive for writing papers, they ultimately prevent mistakes and save time.

## How Do We Pull This off?

Enter **Quarto**...

- Quarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.

- It's the 'new generation' of R Markdown, designed to work multiple programming languages + tools in an aligned way.

- Quarto can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more.

# Let's Get Started!

## Your Turn!

- Go to the _Getting Started_ chapter of the workshop book and follow the instructions for your programming language.

```{r}
library(countdown)

countdown(minutes = 10,
          color_background = "#FFCD00")
```

## Anatomy of a Quarto Document

-   Metadata & Header (YAML)

``` yaml
---
format: html
---
```

. . .

-   Code

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: true
library(dplyr)
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(mpg), .groups = "drop")
```

. . .

-   Text

``` markdown
# Heading 1
This is a sentence with some **bold text**, some *italic text* and an [image](image.png).
```
