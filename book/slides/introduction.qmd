## More Specifically...

We want _Dynamic Document Generation_, where we can:

- combine narrative with code

- automatically generate figures and tables

- automatically render results in text

- format the content into a scientific paper (including citations!)

- rinse & repeat

## Advantages

**(1) Eliminate human error in copying and pasting results**

_We found that half of all published psychology papers that use null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion_
_([Nuijten et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2))_

## Advantages

**(2) Easy revisions and specification of desired figures and tables**

_When revisions are requested, one might have to tweak tables and figures by hand constantly, leading to a major incentive never to rerun analyses because it would mean re-pasting and re-illustrating all the numbers and figures in a paper._

## Advantages

**(3) Promote computational reproducibility **

- Easy verification and replication of research findings

- While programming environments may seem counter-intuitive for writing papers, they ultimately prevent mistakes and save time.

## How Do We Pull This off?

Enter **Quarto**...

- QuartoÂ® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.

- It's the 'new generation' of R Markdown, designed to work multiple programming languages + tools in an aligned way.

- Quarto can weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more.

# Let's Get Started!

## Your Turn!

- Open the workshop materials: **[https://edu.nl/ffhra](https://edu.nl/ffhra)**
- Go to the _Getting Started_ chapter and follow the instructions for your programming language.

```{r}
library(countdown)

countdown(minutes = 10,
          color_background = "#FFCD00")
```
