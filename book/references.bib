With Quarto you can create documents, books, presentations, blogs or other online resources. In this 2 day workshop you will learn about the Quarto format for technical communication and computation. We'll teach you how to get started creating and fully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) and the use of RStudio's Visual Editor which provides a user interface for editing all of Pandoc markdown. We will also provide an overview of Quarto's developer tooling support in alternative tools such as Jupyter, VS Code, and any text editors depending on learner interest. We will briefly cover how to generate robust tables/plots in Quarto. Lastly, we will cover Quarto Projects for aggregating many files such as complex web sites or entire books.},

That said: a research compendium can be constructed with minimal technical knowledge. The main purpose is that all elements of a project are published together, so a basic folder structure combining all components can be sufficient.},
