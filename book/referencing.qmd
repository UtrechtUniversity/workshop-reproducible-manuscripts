### Exercise

We're assuming installation of Zotero Desktop, Zotero Connector, and Better BibTex for Zotero were completed successfully.

1. Open **Zotero Desktop**

- log into your account
- create a new collection for your project, for example: `my-reproducible-manuscript`

2. Open your **Web Browser**

- double-check that you can find the **Zotero Connector** in your browser
- run a web / Google Scholar search for "Allison Horst PalmerPenguins Package"
- use the Zotero Connector to save the reference to your collection

3. In **Zotero Desktop**,

- right-click your collection and select _Export Collection_
- for the **Format**, select _Better BibTex_
- click the option to _Keep updated_
- provide the file name as `references` and **save it in the same folder as your Quarto document**

4. In **RStudio** or **VS Code**,

- update the YAML to include the bibliography:

```
---
title: "My Reproducible Manuscript"
format: html
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

5. **Insert a Citation**

- in the text of your Quarto document, insert the _PalmerPenguins_ citation (hint: refer to the slides and your .bib file to figure how to format the citation)

- alternatively, when using the Visual Editor option - you can use the citation dialog/option to insert citations directly.

- render the document

6. **Repetition**

- repeat Step 2 with another reference
- repeat Step 5 to insert the new reference
- if you did a brackted citation before, do an in-text citation this time (or vice versa)

**Note:* Steps 1, 3, 4 can be skipped. These were a one-time thing.
