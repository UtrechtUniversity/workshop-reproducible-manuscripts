## Exercise

Refer to the dummy R & Python scripts that have been provided in the `workshop-materials`: 

- Insert a setup code chunk at the beginning of your document (i.e. below the YAML header) to load the necessary packages.

- Create a code chunk in the `Results` section of your document

- Copy a piece/section of the dummy script and paste it into the code chunk.

- Run the code chunk and see if it works alright.

- Repeat the previous three steps until the whole dummy script has been incorporated within code chunks in your manuscript.

- Render the document and check the output.

- Play around with the code chunk options and re-render the document.
