This workshops is developed by Research Data Management Support at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. We teach this workshop every 2 months, have a look at the agenda for information on dates and locations.\nIn this 3-hour workshop, you will use the Quarto publishing system in conjunction with R or Python (you can use the programming language you prefer) to create a publication-ready manuscript that combines data, code, text, and references. More specifically, you will learn how to:\nThis workflow reduces the amount of human error, improves computational reproducibility and makes updating your scientific manuscript more efficient."
