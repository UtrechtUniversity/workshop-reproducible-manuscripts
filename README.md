## Workshop description

In this 3-hour workshop, participants will learn to use the Quarto publishing system in conjunction with R or Python to create a publication-ready manuscript that combines data, code, text, and references. More specifically, they will learn how to: 

- Create a reproducible project (folder) structure
- Use Markdown syntax effectively for writing text
- Run analyses in code chunks or cells
- Manage references using Zotero and Better BibTex for Zotero
- 'Render' your Quarto project to Word, HTML, and pdf files 

## Upcoming workshops

We teach this workshop every 2 months, have a look at the [agenda](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/workshops/writing-reproducible-manuscripts-in-r-and-python) for information on dates and locations, and to register for the workshop.
